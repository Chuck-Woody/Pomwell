In Pomwell users will be welcomed to a single page web application where they will be able to
use a pomodoro timer to maintain a higher productivity for longer periods of time while protecting
the users mental health. During the breaks breathing exercises, posture corrections tips, and
stretching sequences will allow the user to rejuvenate. During the work sessions the user can
specify calming white noise, silence, looping their favorite youtube video, or a spotify playlist.

  Set a work timer interval
  Set a break timer interval
  Sets a wellness goal that tailors what wellness tips and videos are shown during the break
  change the theme of the timer
  Write down a task and increment the amount of timers

Moonshot features:

  - Accountability mode. Detects when users walk away from their computer via use of webcam
  - Break visibility. People would be able to interact with others during their breaks
